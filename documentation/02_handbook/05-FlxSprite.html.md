title: "FlxSprite"
```

FlxSprites are the core building blocks of all Flixel games. They offer a friendly API to add animation, movement and features for the needs of most games.

It is pretty common place to extend `FlxSprite` for your own game's needs for example a `SpaceShip` class may extend `FlxSprite` but could have additional variables for the game like `shieldStrength` or `shieldPower`. When you extend `FlxSprite` it is important to remember to use `super.update()` if you override the `update` method, as you would do for any other `FlxBasic`.

#### loadGraphic()

This method is the easiest way to use a single image for your FlxSprite. Using the OpenFL asset system defined in the project xml file you simply have to define a path to your image and the compiler will do the rest.

```haxe
var player = new FlxSprite();
player.loadGraphic("assets/player.png");
add(player);
```

#### makeGraphic()

This method is a handy way to make a simple color fill to quickly test a feature or have the basic shape.

```haxe
var whiteSquare = new FlxSprite();
whiteSquare.makeGraphic(200, 200, FlxColor.WHITE);
add(whiteSquare);
```

#### Position

```haxe
whiteSquare.x = 200;
whiteSquare.y = 300;
```

#### â€‹kill()

This method is useful for when you want to hide a sprite from the stage but keep it available to reuse later. For example you may want to respawn an enemy the player has killed.

#### destroy()

This method is destructive to the sprite and should be used when you want to make sure that the sprite will be cleared from memory. It is commonly used inside a FlxState's overriden destroy method.

### Animation

Flixel supports spritesheet animation.

```haxe
player.loadGraphic("assets/player.png", true, true, 32, 32);
player.animation.add("walk", [0, 1, 2, 3], 5, true);
player.animation.play("walk");
```
