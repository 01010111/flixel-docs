title: "Part I: Setup"
```

The first things we need to do is install all of the components we need to work with HaxeFlixel. These are:

*   Haxe
*   Lime
*   OpenFL
*   HaxeFlixel
*   FlashDevelop
*   Flash Debug Player

There is a more verbose explanation on installing many of these things
[here](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/setup/)(OpenFL), and
[here](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)(HaxeFlixel), but Iâ€™ll walk you through it quickly.
If anything goes wrong, check there for more information.

<p>Assuming everything went smoothly, you should be all set! Now we can actually get to the fun part and start coding!</p>
