title: "1 - Setup"
```

The first things we need to do is install all of the components we need to work with HaxeFlixel. For that, please follow our general [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started/) guide. This will get you:

* Haxe
* Lime
* OpenFL
* HaxeFlixel

Once you have all that, we're still missing these two things:

* FlashDevelop - download and install the latest version from [here](http://www.flashdevelop.org/)
* Flash Debug Player - head over [here](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html) and download and install the
Flash Debug Player (scroll down and choose "Download the Flash Player projector content debugger").

Assuming everything went smoothly, you should be all set - now we can actually get to the fun part and start coding!
