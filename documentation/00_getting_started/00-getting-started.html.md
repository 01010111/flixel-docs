Welcome to HaxeFlixel, here we will show you how to setup your system to start making games with Mac, Linux or Windows.

Getting started requires three steps:

1. [Install Haxe](http://haxe.org/download)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
3. [HaxeFlixel Hello World](/documentation/hello-world)

After that, you have to choose an editor / IDE to work in. Several popular options have their own pages here:

- [Visual Studio Code](/documentation/visual-studio-code) (recommended)
- [HaxeDevelop / FlashDevelop](/documentation/FlashDevelop)
- [Sublime Text](/documentation/sublime-text)

A more comprehensive list of options can be found on [haxe.org](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html).

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes (depending on the speed of your Internet connection for downloading the components).

If you require some help, reach out via any of the [communication channels](/documentation/community).
