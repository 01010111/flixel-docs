Welcome to HaxeFlixel! Here we will show you how to setup your Windows, Linux or Mac system to start making games.

Getting started requires three steps:

1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.0.0-rc.2/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
3. [Run Hello World](/documentation/hello-world)

After that, you have to choose an editor / IDE to work in. Two popular options have their own pages here:

- [Visual Studio Code](/documentation/visual-studio-code) (recommended)
- [HaxeDevelop / FlashDevelop](/documentation/FlashDevelop)

A more comprehensive list of options can be found on [haxe.org](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html).

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes (depending on the speed of your Internet connection for downloading the components).

If you need more help, reach out via any of the [communication channels](/documentation/community).
