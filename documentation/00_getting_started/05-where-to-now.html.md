If you have successfully compiled a Hello World sample, the best place we recommend is to jump to our large collection of demos to learn by example, try improving a game and pulling one apart to see how it works:

*   [Demos](http://haxeflixel.com/demos)
*   [Source for the demos](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos/tree/master)

If you are totally new to Flixel, please review our Handbook here:

*   [Handbook](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/haxeflixel-handbook/)

For former AS3 developers, you can get a quick start on Haxe from these:

*   [AS3 and Haxe Comparison](http://www.openfl.org/archive/developer/documentation/actionscript-developers/)
*   [â€‹Haxe API](http://api.haxe.org/)

For ways to get in touch with the community, check out this list of [various communication channels](/documentation/community/).

Furthermore, this documentation and website is the front of HaxeFlixel information and we welcome additions from users like you. :)
