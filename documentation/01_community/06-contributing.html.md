HaxeFlixel is a an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project with humble beginnings sparked from a passion for the technology and game development. Everyone working on the project has come together to create a friendly and flexible approach to make this library and community enjoyable and a robust solution for cross-platform 2D games.

### Donations

You can support the core developers by giving a monthly donation via [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/haxeflixel) or by giving a one time donation though PayPal by clicking here (INSERT PAYPAL BUTTON).

All donations will be divided on a monthly basis amongst the [owners team](https://github.com/orgs/HaxeFlixel/teams/owners), plus two additional recepients, one for website costs, and one for community contributions. Funds for community contributions will accummulate until the core developers decide there is a good use for them (whether to post a bounty for a necessary feature, or to reward a particularly significant contribution).
